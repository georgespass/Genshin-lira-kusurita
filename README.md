### Media Controls
You can now control the Lyre natively by using your media controls that some keyboards have as special function keys. This integrates with other music applications as well.

### Play using your own MIDI Input Device
If you have your own MIDI instrument, this will let you play directly to the Genshin Lyre. This lets you play directly without using a MIDI file.

### Playlist Controls & History
A playlist allows you to play songs continuously without having to open a new file after a song has finished.

### Hold notes & Merge nearby notes
  - You can set the player to hold sustained notes (does not really make a difference. Off by default.)
  - Some songs sound better when nearby notes are merged see [#4](https://github.com/sabihoshi/GenshinLyreMidiPlayer/issues/4) for an example

### Light Mode
You can set the player to light mode/dark mode (uses your system's theme by default.)

## About

### What are MIDI files?
MIDI files (.mid) is a set of instructions that play various instruments on what are called tracks. You can enable specific tracks that you want it to play. It converts the notes on the track into the keyboard inputs in Genshin Impact. Currently it is tuned to C major.

### Can this get me banned?
The short answer is that it's uncertain. I have used this in development with my own account for a week now and so far, I have not gotten banned. But use it at your own risk. Do not play songs that will spam the keyboard, listen to the MIDI file first and make sure to play only one instrument so that the tool doesn't spam keyboard inputs. [Here is miHoYo's response](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5763) to using 3rd party tools.
